DFS - Depth First Search traversal of a graph,
algorithm "visits" all nodes "reachable" from a given node

Consider a (di)graph G and node u in G
assume stored as adjacency list

func DFS(u):
     mark u as visited
     for v in Successor(u):
     	 if not visited v:
	    DFS(v)
remember to maintain a call-stack for hand simulation

Very simple to write and understand,
but the hidden utility in the visited metric is very powerful
The same idea can be used in a myriad of contexts

Of course, simply visiting every node is not useful by itself,
usually something is done in each call of DFS to the node u,
e.g. adding the key of u to the running total, or simply printing key
Therefore it is very important to ensure no multiple-visits ever happen
otherwise bad things like infinite loops could occur

In a BST, visiting-from can be defined, different for in/post/preorder.
This is not so for more general graphs that lack parent-child structure

Note that this implementation of DFS does not visit all edges,
especially clear when the digraph is not a DAG. 
This happens when the upcoming successor node is already visited

In fact, the edges that are visited form a tree, the DFS tree
and a special tree at that, the same as a general search tree
The extra edges can fall into back, forward, or cross,
depending on the relation between their from and to nodes

DFS as implemented runs in O(|V| + |E|) linear time
As long as time spent verifying a node is visited is O(1) time

Of course, a digraph may not have every node reachable from every node
and so DFS can miss some nodes

In some more sophisticated uses of DFS, it is necessary to "visit"
a node more than once, only marking it truly visited after the last time
it is accessed.


v is visited <=> v is reachable from u
=> is clear, since the algorithm follows only possible paths
<= is a little harder,
consider the path u=v0 -> v1 -> v2 -> ... -> vk
 for k=0, then clearly the whole path is marked visited, it is just u
 assume that k= i-1 is proven already, then the node v(k-1) is visited
  but then vk is in Successor(v(k-1)) it for sure will be visited

FullDFS: solves the problem of quasidisconnected graphs not being
traversable through basic DFS:

Include
array pi[], indexed over each node v, the parent of v in the DFS forest
array color[], same, values of unvisit,seen,visit (pick color names)
each node has a discoveryTime and finishTime
     the time first seen, and the time marked visited

func DFS(G):
     for each v:
     	 v <- unvisited
	 pi[v] <- nil
	 time <- 0
     for each v:
     	 if v unvisited:
	    DFSR(v)

func DFSR(u):
     u <- seen
     dTime[u] <- ++time #discovery
     for each v in Successor(u):
     	 if v unvisited:
	    pi[v] = u
	    DFSR(v)
     u <- visited
     fTime[u] <- ++time #finish

For sure, every single node v will be visited by the end,
and the pi array will give the DFS forest
There is now a new type of extra edge, a cross-tree edge
that can only point from a tree created afterwards to a tree created before

How is ths DFSR portion different from the basic DFS?
it uses a seen state to stop a loop from a seen node propagating back to
itself endlessly and then sets it as visited,
while basic DFS sets a node to visited immediately then recurses
also DFSR sets discovery and finish times to nodes, useful
 sometimes written up as dTime/fTime

clearly dTime < fTime, but also
dTime < dTime[child] and fTime > fTime[child]
for any edge in DFS forest
pictorially this means the DFS forest can be arranged like:
[               ][  ]
 [      ] [    ]  []
  [][  ]   [][]
     []
where a node's timespan being totally below another one indicates an edge
something like:
     [      ]
    [   ]
can absolutely never happen, posited by...

(Borrowing notation from space theory, write u under v to mean
that u is in the DFS subtree of v, define over relation obviously)

The Parenthesis Theorem follows:
forall nodes u,v such that u != v
       exactly one is true:
       	       [du,fu] disjoint [dv,fv] and u not under v and v not under u
	       [du,fu] subset [dv,fv] and u under v
	       [du,fu] superset [dv,fv] and u over v

the search tree property of DFS also gives a partial ordering of nodes
