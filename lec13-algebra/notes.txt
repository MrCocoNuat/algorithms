Rings are tuples (R,o in R,i in R,+,*) abbreviated to R such that:
(forall x,y,z in R)(x+y=y+x AND x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z AND x*y=y*z AND x*(y*z)=(x*y)*z)
	- commutatitivity and associativity of +, *
	- (R,o,+) is a group
AND (forall x in R)(o+x=x) AND (forall x in R)(exists n in R)(x+n=o)
    	- identity and inverses with +
AND (forall x in R)(i*x=x)
    	- identity with *
	- (R,i,*) is a monoid
AND (forall x,y,z in R)(x*(y+z)=x*y+x*z)
    	- distributions of * over +
	
customarily, insert the additional axiom, NOT (i = o), for convenience.

Rings include familiar sets of numbers (and the customary operations +,*) Z, Z_n, Q, R, C
The trivial ring ({k},k,k,+,*), for which many (non-trivial ring) theorems don't hold

usually o and i are named 0 and 1, as archetypes.

These give easy ring theorems that look like arithmetic theorems

Some elements in some rings may have inverses with *:
Define R* to be the set of elements in R for which they have a * inverse in the ring,
i.e. R* = { x in R | (exists y in R)(x*y=1)}
R* is closed under *

For those rings where R* = R\{o}, (R,0,1,+,*) is additionally a field, sometimes abbreviated to R itself.
Note that since (forall x in R)(0*x=0), 0 notin R*

The familiar sets of numbers Z_p, Q, R, C are fields, notably Z is not.

An important field theorem: Let R be a field, then
(a in R* AND b in R) IMPLIES (exists! z in R)(a*z=b)

Let R be a ring, then R[x] is the ring of polynomials in x with coefficients in R.
elements of R are also in R[x], the constant terms, and 0/1 still work
R[x] can be thought of as a variadic vector
Extending this vectorization, define R[x,y] = (R[x])[y], and so on


On polynomials g in R[x]:
deg(g) and lc(g) are degree and leadingcoeff.
deg(0) in (-infty,-1], whatever makes theorems work, and lc(0) = 0
Z_2[x] is exceedingly simple, there is no need to write down coeffs. 

deg(gh) <= deg(g) + deg(h), the < is for when lc(g)*lc(h) = 0.
Thus the equality is enforced if R is a field,


Polynomials suggest a function:
G : u in R MAP g[x -> u], the substitution of all occurences of x with u.
call the map g(u) for convenience.

Fermat's Little Theorem: (forall p prime)(forall a in Z_p)(a^p = a)
i.e. the functions generated by x^p and x are extensionally equal,
even if the polynomials are intensionally different
Since Z_p is a field, this also means that by cancellation,
(forall p prime)(forall a in Z_p)(a^(p-1) = 1)

Polynomial roots:
R is a ring, g in R[x]. Then u is a root of g if g(u) = 0

Interpolation:
F is a field, given a set of k points (u,g(u)), a unique
polynomial with degree less than k will evaluate to all k points.
Additionally, any polynomial of degree k has at most k roots.

Division:
Define the divides relation similarly with the * operation in F,
Now given g, h in F[x] and h != 0,
(exists! q,r in F[x])(g = hq + r AND deg(r) < deg(h))

Factor Theorem:
(g in F[x] AND u is a root of g) IMPLIES ( (x-u) | g )

Lagrange Interpolation:
like it is in reals,
Given k pairs (u_k,v_k) such that u_k are unique,
(exists! g = \sum_{i=1}^k v_i\frac{\prod_{j\neq i} (x - u_j)}{\prod_{j\neq i} (u_i - u_j)})
at any input u_i, in the i sum term, the product terms are equal, so the fraction is equal to 1
in any other sum term, the product numerator contains 0. Therefore, g(u_i) = v_i
