Rings are tuples (R,o in R,i in R,+,*) abbreviated to R such that:
(forall x,y,z in R)(x+y=y+x AND x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z AND x*y=y*z AND x*(y*z)=(x*y)*z)
	- commutatitivity and associativity of +, *
	- (R,o,+) is a group
AND (forall x in R)(o+x=x) AND (forall x in R)(exists n in R)(x+n=o)
    	- identity and inverses with +
AND (forall x in R)(i*x=x)
    	- identity with *
	- (R,i,*) is a monoid
AND (forall x,y,z in R)(x*(y+z)=x*y+x*z)
    	- distributions of * over +
	
customarily, insert the additional axiom, NOT (i = o), for convenience.

Rings include familiar sets of numbers (and the customary operations +,*) Z, Z_n, Q, R, C
The trivial ring ({k},k,k,+,*) which is extremely boring,

These give easy ring theorems that look like arithmetic theorems

Some elements in some rings may have inverses with *:
Define R* to be the set of elements in R for which they have a * inverse in the ring,
i.e. R* = { x in R | (exists y in R)(x*y=i)}
R* is closed under *

For those rings where R* = R\{o}, (R,o,i,+,*) is additionally a field, sometimes abbreviated to R itself.
Note that since (forall x in R)(o*x=o), o notin R*

The familiar sets of numbers Z_p, Q, R, C are fields
