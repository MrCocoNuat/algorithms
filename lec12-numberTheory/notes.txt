review oOBf discrete math - number theory in integers only

define the divides relation a|b equivalent to exists z so that az = b

some universals:
forall a a|0 and 1|a and -1|a
some properties - divides is:
reflexive a|a
nearly antisymmetric a|b and b|a implies a= +-b
transitive a|b and b|c implies a|c

the division with remainder function:
divide(a,b) = (q,r) where a = bq+r and 0<=r<b
condition is that b > 0
proved that (q,r) is unique for all (a,b), and exists for all (a,b)
so this function is well-defined
additionally define the remainder = modulus a%b (for positive b only!) as r


the greatest common divisor function:
gcd(a,b) = d
where d is nonnegative and forall d' is common divisor, d'|d
then d is immediately unique if it exists; does it exist?
an algorithm that calculates gcd(a,b) will suffice:
Euclidean Algorithm for gcd(a,b):
	  if b = 0: return a
	  return gcd(b, a%b)

then algorithm takes O(log n) division steps to finish
since it is easy to prove that a_i+1 * 2 <= a_i-1
      so argument at least halves after two steps
in compact form, write a_i+1 = a_i-1 - q_i a_i
which ties into the extended Euclidean algorithm

Bezout's:
forall a,b exists s,t such that as+bt=gcd(a,b)
these s,t can be calculated "for free" using extended Euclidean algo:
in compact form, (a,s,t)_i+1 = (a,s,t)_i-1 - q_i * (a,s,t)_i
(a,s,t)_0 = (a,1,0) and (a,s,t)_1 = (b,0,1)
the process ends at (a,s,t)_h-1 = (gcd,co-s,co-t), (a,s,t)_h = (0,...,...)
and co-s, co-t are the cofactors

immediately leading to the special case:
forall a coprime b, exists s,t such that as+bt=1,
very nice for isolation of modular exponents

"coprime" lemma is a result,
c | ab AND a coprime c IMPLIES c | b,
intuitive enough, provable by the above special case

primality and FTA:
duh
FTA(n)'s existence clause can be proven by strong induction on n
assuming primality and all that, very easily, since either n prime or n = ab

FTA(n)'s uniqueness clause can rely on the inequality of
finite prime strings p*p*p... = p*p*p... 
other than cases where one is a reordering of the other
show this with divisibility arguments and induction on the size of each string

knowing the prime decompositions of a and b makes finding
gcd(a,b) and lcm(a,b) exceedingly easy

binary representations:
different representations make different operations easy or hard,
e.g. decimal representation is easy to add but hard to multiply
e.g. prime decompositions are very easy to multiply but hard to add
e.g. binary representation is reasonable to add/multiply but are large

modular congruence:
a == b(mod n) EQUIVALENT n|(a-b)
usually, write with 0 <= b < n.
recall aRb <=> a == b(mod n) is an equivalence relation
aRa' AND bRb' => a+b R a'+b', and also => ab R a'b'

therefore 4*5*6*7*8 mod 17 = (3)*6*7*8 mod 17
= (1)*7*8 mod 17 = (7)*8 mod 17 = 5

solving linear congruences:
8z-4 == 5z-2 (mod 7) #additive operations are fine
3z == 2 (mod 7) #multiplicative is not so straightforward
inverse(3, mod 7) = 5 #modular inverses, since 3*5 == 1 (mod 7)
z = 2*5 (mod 7) = 3 (mod 7) #complete

if n is not prime, then inverse(k, mod n) might not be defined,
e.g. it is never the case that 3k (mod 6) = 1

precisely, inverse(k, mod n) is defined whenever
k coprime n, since then Bezout's asserts EXISTS s,t , sk+nt = 1...
sk = 1 (mod n), so s is the inverse of k
this is called the Key lemma, after  \{20,27,34\}inverse keys.

moreover, inverse is really multivalued, since
sk mod n = (s+n)k mod n = (s+2n)k mod n = ... = 1,
but only take the inverse that is also in 0 < s < k,
that value is the most useful

all the above means that
az = b (mod n) has >=1 solution z iff gcd(a,n)|b
PROVABLE by congruence's definition and Bezout's

Therefore, finding inverse of z:
az mod n = 1
do gcd(n,z) (which must be 1 or inverse doesn't exist at all)
and extended Euclidean gives cofactors:
sz + tn = 1,
and now s is an inverse of z, since sz (mod n) = , easy!
Now of course, for mod prime p then every a has a modular inverse

Cancellation of a given gcd(a,n) = 1 from
az == az' (mod n) to z == z' (mod n)

Comprehensively, to solve

az == b (mod n)
if gcd(a,n) !| b, then no solution
if gcd(a,n) = 1, then:
else, find s = inverse(a, mod n)
asz == sb (mod n)
z == sb (mod n)
and done!
else, gcd(a,n) > 1, then divide the whole equation by the gcd,
into a'z == b' (mod n')
where X' = X/gcd(a,n)
and now gcd(a',n') = 1, solve via the inverse

the total number of congruence solutions is exactly gcd(a,n),
one for each kn/d fraction


e.g. 6z == 22(mod 100)
reduce into:
3z == 11(mod 50)
where 3 has inverse 17:
z == 11*17 (mod 50) == 37 (mod 50)
so in the original, z in {37, 37+50}, no more, else repeats



Onto Algebra!
abstraction into rings of residue classes
Z_n = {[0]_n, [1]_n, [2]_n, ..., [n-1]_n}

ring addition/multiplication works exactly as before

The invertible elements of Z_n are Z*_n,
immediately, [0] notin Z*, and [1] in Z*,
Z*_n is closed under multiplication,
the elements are exactly those that are coprime with n

if n = p prime, this ring is a field,
so every element has a multiplicative inverse,
there are exactly the finite fields in integers
