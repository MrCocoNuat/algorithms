Families of trees must be closed under insert, delete
e.g. perfect trees are not a a tree family

since there must be at least one family member for each size

for any a-b tree, naturally
log_a(leaves) <= height <= log_b(leaves)

Deletion policies, since there is sometimes a choice between
adoption from a sibling with 3 children and merging with a
sibling with 2.

Useful augmentations:

what if number of leaves in subtree is stored at each internal
node as well? enables queries like "how many keys < X?" and "what is 4th smallest key?"

range operations:

tree join/split:
Join (T1,T2) both 2-3 trees efficiently, condition key(T1) <ke7(T2)
if heights equal, put both on a common root, done.
If WLOG h1 < h2, then find the leftest node p in T2 height h1+1,
then add root1 as the leftest child of p, then insert ras normal
