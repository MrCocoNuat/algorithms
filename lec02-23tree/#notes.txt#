families of trees must be closed under insert, delete
e.g. perfect trees are not a a tree family

since there must be at least one family member for each size

for any a-b tree, naturally
log_a(leaves) <= height <= log_b(leaves)

Deletion Policies, since there is sometimes a choice between
adoption from a sibling with 3 children and merging with a
sibling with 2.
