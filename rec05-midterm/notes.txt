recall heap inserts:
insert the new key in the next spot on the complete tree,
then float it up until it is no longer less than its parent
tree is now heapified

heapifying an array takes only linear time, don't heapify each
element one by one but do all subtrees of a height at a time

recall merging binary tree heaps

merging 2-3 tree heaps is constant time if heights are the same,
else do merging of 2-3 trees

recursive 2-3 tree insert method:
if h = 1:
   addLeaf
   update guides
   return degree of node
else:
   c <= insert(key,correct child,h-1)
if c = 0:
   failed, return 0
if c = 4:
   split this node,
   return 2


q7 DFS should start from node d, remember!

recall coin-gathering with general digraphs,
first coalesce SCCs and then toposort,
then DP backwards search

a digraph of five nodes where the path that
collects the most coins is not a simple path (contains cycle)
is:
a C3 graph and two extra nodes not joined to
the same of the 3 nodes, with the path
traveling through all 5
