Review:

f = O(g) i.e. f in O(g) iff
exists c : exists n0 : forall n >= n0 : |f(n)| <= c|g(n)|

i.e. for all sufficiently large input n,
f(n) is bounded above by some constant multiple of g(n)

Implicit Landau notation:
writing cos(x) = 1 - x^2/2 + OMEGA(x^4), means that the error term
is some function of x in OMEGA(x^4) - reminder OMEGA is the ">=" relation
in fact it is some infinite function x^4/24 - x^6/720 + ...

THETA is a symmetric relation, (remember relation theory?)

f = o(g) iff
forall c : exists n0 : forall n >= n0 : |f(n)| <= c|g(n)|

Limit comparison theorem:
lim |f(n)|/|g(n)| = 0, k, infty => f=o(g),f=THETA(g),f=omega(g)

Time complexity of nested loops:
e.g.
FOR i in (1,...,n):
    FOR j in (1,...,i):
    	<constant time operation>
Then the time taken is THETA(n^2)

Careful about exactly which elements are iterated over!
i <- 1
WHILE i < n:
      i <- 2i
      <constant time>
takes THETA(log n) time

Estimating a series can be done by integral,
e.g. SUM[1,...,n] 1/i = int[1,n] 1/i di + O(1) = ln(n) + O(1)
The two sums differing by at most the E-M constant 0.58...

This works especially well when only a one-sided bound is wanted.
since the above integral can be trivially made to above bound
the series by a simple shift.
Just make sure that at each input i the bound really holds (offby1)

Of course a shifted integral can also be made to bound the series
from the other side, providing a two-sided bound and a possible
THETA statment

Extended into series minmax theorem: (Very important!)
f continuous, monotone
then
int f(x)dx + m <= SUM f(i) <= int f(x)dx + M
where m = min(f(a),f(b)) and M = max(...)

Applying this to the series that creates harmonic numbers H_n:
ln(n) + 1/n <= H_n <= ln(n) + 1/1
Therefore H_n = ln(n) + O(1), encompassing the E-M constant

Adapt to power sums:
n^k - (n-1)^k = cSUM i^(k-1) + cSUM i^(k-2) + ...
for some coefficients c



Infinite series can either converge (SUM (1/2)^n),
diverge to infinity (SUM 3),
diverge into oscillation (SUM (-1)^n),
or diverge chaotically (SUM sin(n))

Review of convergence tests!
ratio test:
ratio between successive terms
<1 converges, >1 diverges, =1 || DNE inconclusive
